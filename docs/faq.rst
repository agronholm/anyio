Frequently Asked Questions

Why is Curio not supported as a backend?
----------------------------------------

Curio_ was supported in AnyIO before v3.0. Support for it was dropped for two reasons:

#. Its interface allowed only coroutine functions to access the Curio_ kernel. This forced AnyIO to
   follow suit in its own API design, making it difficult to adapt existing applications that
   relied on synchronous callbacks to use AnyIO. It also interfered with the goal of matching Trio's
   API in functions with the same purpose (e.g. ``Event.set()``).
#. The maintainer specifically requested Curio_ support to be removed from AnyIO
   (`issue 185 <https://github.com/agronholm/anyio/issues/185>`_).

Why is Twisted not supported as a backend?
------------------------------------------

The minimum requirement to support Twisted_ would be for sniffio_ to be able to detect a running
Twisted event loop (and be able to tell when Twisted_ is being run on top of its asyncio reactor).
This is not currently supported in sniffio_, so AnyIO cannot support Twisted either.
