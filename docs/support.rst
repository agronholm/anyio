Getting help
============

If you are having trouble with AnyIO, make sure you've first checked the :doc:`FAQ <faq>` to see if
your question is answered there. If not, you have a couple ways for getting support:

* Post a question on `Stack Overflow`_ and use the ``anyio`` tag
* Join the `python-trio/AnyIO`_ room on Gitter

.. _Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/
.. _python-trio/AnyIO: https://gitter.im/python-trio/AnyIO

Reporting bugs
==============

If you're fairly certain that you have discovered a bug, you can `file an issue`_ on Github.
If you feel unsure, come talk to us first! The issue tracker is **not** the proper venue for asking
support questions.
