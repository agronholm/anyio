The basics
==========

.. py:currentmodule:: anyio

AnyIO requires Python 3.8 or later to run. It is recommended that you set up a
virtualenv_ when developing or playing around with AnyIO.

Installation
------------

To install AnyIO, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install anyio

To install a supported version of trio_, you can install it as an extra like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install anyio[trio]

Running async programs
----------------------

The simplest possible AnyIO program looks like this::

    from anyio import run


    async def main():
        print('Hello, world!')

    run(main)

This will run the program above on the default backend (asyncio). To run it on another
supported backend, say trio_, you can use the ``backend`` argument, like so::

    run(main, backend='trio')

But AnyIO code is not required to be run via :func:`run`. You can just as well use the
native ``run()`` function of the backend library::

    import sniffio
    import trio
    from anyio import sleep


    async def main():
        print('Hello')
        await sleep(1)
        print("I'm running on", sniffio.current_async_library())

    trio.run(main)

.. versionchanged:: 4.0.0
    On the ``asyncio`` backend, ``anyio.run()`` now uses a back-ported version of
    :class:`asyncio.Runner` on Pythons older than 3.11.

.. _backend options:

Backend specific options
------------------------

**Asyncio**:

* options covered in the documentation of :class:`asyncio.Runner`
* ``use_uvloop`` (``bool``, default=False): Use the faster uvloop_ event loop
  implementation, if available (this is a shorthand for passing
  ``loop_factory=uvloop.new_event_loop``, and is ignored if ``loop_factory`` is passed
  a value other than ``None``)

**Trio**: options covered in the
`official documentation
<https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-core.html#trio.run>`_

.. versionchanged:: 3.2.0
    The default value of ``use_uvloop`` was changed to ``False``.
.. versionchanged:: 4.0.0
    The ``policy`` option was replaced with ``loop_factory``.

.. _uvloop: https://pypi.org/project/uvloop/

Using native async libraries
----------------------------

AnyIO lets you mix and match code written for AnyIO and code written for the
asynchronous framework of your choice. There are a few rules to keep in mind however:

* You can only use "native" libraries for the backend you're running, so you cannot, for
  example, use a library written for trio together with a library written for asyncio.
* Tasks spawned by these "native" libraries on backends other than trio_ are not subject
  to the cancellation rules enforced by AnyIO
* Threads spawned outside of AnyIO cannot use :func:`.from_thread.run` to call
  asynchronous code
