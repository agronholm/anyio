Creating and managing tasks
===========================

.. py:currentmodule:: anyio

A *task* is a unit of execution that lets you do many things concurrently that need waiting on.
This works so that while you can have any number of tasks, the asynchronous event loop can only
run one of them at a time. When the task encounters an ``await`` statement that requires the task
to sleep until something happens, the event loop is then free to work on another task. When the
thing the first task was waiting is complete, the event loop will resume the execution of that task
on the first opportunity it gets.

Task handling in AnyIO loosely follows the trio_ model. Tasks can be created (*spawned*) using
*task groups*. A task group is an asynchronous context manager that makes sure that all its child
tasks are finished one way or another after the context block is exited. If a child task, or the
code in the enclosed context block raises an exception, all child tasks are cancelled. Otherwise
the context manager just waits until all child tasks have exited before proceeding.

Here's a demonstration::

    from anyio import sleep, create_task_group, run


    async def sometask(num):
        print('Task', num, 'running')
        await sleep(1)
        print('Task', num, 'finished')


    async def main():
        async with create_task_group() as tg:
            for num in range(5):
                tg.start_soon(sometask, num)

        print('All tasks finished!')

    run(main)

Starting and initializing tasks
-------------------------------

Sometimes it is very useful to be able to wait until a task has successfully initialized itself.
For example, when starting network services, you can have your task start the listener and then
signal the caller that initialization is done. That way, the caller can now start another task that
depends on that service being up and running. Also, if the socket bind fails or something else goes
wrong during initialization, the exception will be propagated to the caller which can then catch
and handle it.

This can be done with :meth:`TaskGroup.start() <.abc.TaskGroup.start>`::

    from anyio import TASK_STATUS_IGNORED, create_task_group, connect_tcp, create_tcp_listener, run
    from anyio.abc import TaskStatus


    async def handler(stream):
        ...


    async def start_some_service(port: int, *, task_status: TaskStatus[None] = TASK_STATUS_IGNORED):
        async with await create_tcp_listener(local_host='127.0.0.1', local_port=port) as listener:
            task_status.started()
            await listener.serve(handler)


    async def main():
        async with create_task_group() as tg:
            await tg.start(start_some_service, 5000)
            async with await connect_tcp('127.0.0.1', 5000) as stream:
                ...


    run(main)

The target coroutine function **must** call ``task_status.started()`` because the task that is
calling with :meth:`TaskGroup.start() <.abc.TaskGroup.start>` will be blocked until then. If the
spawned task never calls it, then the :meth:`TaskGroup.start() <.abc.TaskGroup.start>` call will
raise a ``RuntimeError``.

.. note:: Unlike :meth:`~.abc.TaskGroup.start_soon`, :meth:`~.abc.TaskGroup.start` needs an ``await``.

Handling multiple errors in a task group
----------------------------------------

It is possible for more than one task to raise an exception in a task group. This can happen when
a task reacts to cancellation by entering either an exception handler block or a ``finally:``
block and raises an exception there. This raises the question: which exception is propagated from
the task group context manager? The answer is "both". In practice this means that a special
exception, :exc:`ExceptionGroup` (or :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup`) is raised which contains both
exception objects.

To catch such exceptions potentially nested in groups, special measures are required.
On Python 3.11 and later, you can use the ``except*`` syntax to catch multiple exceptions::

    try:
        async with TaskGroup() as tg:
            tg.start_soon(some_task)
            tg.start_soon(another_task)
    except* ValueError:
        ...  # handle each ValueError
    except* KeyError:
        ...  # handle each KeyError

If compatibility with older Python versions is required, you can use the ``catch()`` function from
the exceptiongroup_ package::

    from exceptiongroup import catch

    def handle_valueerror(exc: ValueError) -> None:
        ...  # handle each ValueError

    def handle_keyerror(exc: KeyError) -> None:
        ...  # handle each KeyError

    with catch({
        ValueError: handle_valueerror,
        KeyError: handle_keyerror
    }):
        async with TaskGroup() as tg:
            tg.start_soon(some_task)
            tg.start_soon(another_task)

If you need to set local variables in the handlers, declare them as ``nonlocal``::

    def handle_valueerror(exc):
        nonlocal somevariable
        somevariable = 'whatever'

Context propagation
-------------------

Whenever a new task is spawned, `context`_ will be copied to the new task. It is important to note
*which* context will be copied to the newly spawned task. It is not the context of the task group's
host task that will be copied, but the context of the task that calls
:meth:`TaskGroup.start() <.abc.TaskGroup.start>` or
:meth:`TaskGroup.start_soon() <.abc.TaskGroup.start_soon>`.

Differences with asyncio.TaskGroup
----------------------------------

The :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` class, added in Python 3.11, is very similar in design to
the AnyIO :class:`~TaskGroup` class. The asyncio counterpart has some important
differences in its semantics, however:

* Tasks are spawned solely through :meth:`~asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task`; there is no
  ``start()`` or ``start_soon()`` method
* The :meth:`~asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task` method returns a task object which can be
  awaited on (or cancelled)
* Tasks spawned via :meth:`~asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task` can only be cancelled
  individually (there is no ``cancel()`` method or similar in the task group)
* When a task spawned via :meth:`~asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task` is cancelled before its
  coroutine has started running, it will not get a chance to handle the cancellation
  exception
* :class:`asyncio.TaskGroup` does not allow starting new tasks after an exception in
  one of the tasks has triggered a shutdown of the task group
