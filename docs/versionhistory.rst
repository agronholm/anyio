Version history
===============

This library adheres to `Semantic Versioning 2.0 <http://semver.org/>`_.

**UNRELEASED**

- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the ``anyio.finalize()`` context manager since as of curio
  1.0, it is no longer necessary. Use ``async_generator.aclosing()`` instead.
- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Asynchronous file I/O functionality now uses a common code base
  (``anyio.fileio.AsyncFile``) instead of backend-native classes
- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Socket code has been refactored:

  - Support for ``ProactorEventLoop`` on the asyncio backend has been added. This allows asyncio
    applications to use AnyIO on Windows even without using AnyIO as the entry point.
  - TLS functionality has been split off from ``SocketStream`` and can now work over arbitrary
    streams â€“ you can now establish a TLS encrypted communications pathway using any bytes-based
    receive/send stream pair.
  - ``connect_tcp()`` has been split into ``connect_tcp()`` and ``connect_tcp_with_tls()``
  - Socket server functionality has been refactored into a trio-like listener system which is
    network agnostic
  - Support for the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` option (allows binding more than one socket to the same
    address/port combination, as long as they all have this option set) has been added to TCP
    listeners and UDP sockets
  - The ``reuse_address`` option was replaced with ``reuse_port`` in ``create_udp_socket()``.
    This switches on the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` option. The ``SO_REUSEADDR`` is not used under any
    circumstances with UDP sockets.
  - Added the ``family`` attribute to socket streams and listeners (for getting the address family)
  - Removed the ``notify_socket_closing()`` function as it is no longer used by AnyIO
  - The ``send_eof()`` method was added to all (bidirectional) streams
- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Renamed some functions and methods to match their corresponding names
  in Trio:

  - ``Stream.close()`` -> ``Stream.aclose()``
  - ``AsyncFile.close()`` -> ``AsyncFile.aclose()``
  - ``anyio.aopen()`` -> ``anyio.open_file()``
  - ``anyio.receive_signals()`` -> ``anyio.open_signal_receiver()``
  - ``anyio.run_in_thread()`` -> ``anyio.run_sync_in_worker_thread()``
  - ``anyio.current_default_thread_limiter()`` -> ``anyio.current_default_worker_thread_limiter()``
  - ``anyio.exceptions.ResourceBusyError`` -> ``anyio.exceptions.BusyResourceError``
- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Added the ``acquire()`` and ``release()`` methods to the ``Lock``,
  ``Condition`` and ``Semaphore`` classes
- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the ``Event.clear()`` method. You must now replace the event
  object with a new one rather than clear the old one.
- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the ``anyio.create_queue`` function and the ``Queue`` class.
  Use memory object streams instead.
- **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Renamed the ``max_size`` parameter to ``max_bytes`` wherever it
  occurred (this was inconsistently named ``max_bytes`` in some subclasses before)
- Unified checkpoint behavior: a cancellation check now calls ``sleep(0)`` on asyncio and curio,
  allowing the scheduler to switch to a different task
- Added memory object streams
- Dropped support for Python 3.5
- Bumped minimum versions of trio and curio to v0.16 and v1.2, respectively
- Fixed a bug where a task group would abandon its subtasks if its own cancel scope was cancelled
  while it was waiting for subtasks to finish
- Worked around curio's limitation where a task can only be cancelled twice (any cancellations
  beyond that were ignored)
- The asyncio back-end now uses ``asyncio.run()`` behind the scenes which properly shuts down
  async generators and cancels any leftover native tasks

**1.4.0**

- Added async name resolution functions (``anyio.getaddrinfo()`` and ``anyio.getnameinfo()``)
- Added the ``family`` and ``reuse_address`` parameters to ``anyio.create_udp_socket()``
  (Enables multicast support; test contributed by Matthias Urlichs)
- Fixed ``fail.after(0)`` not raising a timeout error on asyncio and curio
- Fixed ``move_on_after()`` and ``fail_after()`` getting stuck on curio in some circumstances
- Fixed socket operations not allowing timeouts to cancel the task
- Fixed API documentation on ``Stream.receive_until()`` which claimed that the delimiter will be
  included in the returned data when it really isn't
- Harmonized the default task names across all backends
- ``wait_all_tasks_blocked()`` no longer considers tasks waiting on ``sleep(0)`` to be blocked
  on asyncio and curio
- Fixed the type of the ``address`` parameter in ``UDPSocket.send()`` to include ``IPAddress``
  objects (which were already supported by the backing implementation)
- Fixed ``UDPSocket.send()`` to resolve host names using ``anyio.getaddrinfo()`` before calling
  ``socket.sendto()`` to avoid blocking on synchronous name resolution
- Switched to using ``anyio.getaddrinfo()`` for name lookups

**1.3.1**

- Fixed warnings caused by trio 0.15
- Worked around a compatibility issue between uvloop and Python 3.9 (missing
  ``shutdown_default_executor()`` method)

**1.3.0**

- Fixed compatibility with Curio 1.0
- Made it possible to assert fine grained control over which AnyIO backends and backend options are
  being used with each test
- Added the ``address`` and ``peer_address`` properties to the ``SocketStream`` interface

**1.2.3**

- Repackaged release (v1.2.2 contained extra files from an experimental
  branch which broke imports)

**1.2.2**

- Fixed ``CancelledError`` leaking from a cancel scope on asyncio if the task previously received a
  cancellation exception
- Fixed ``AttributeError`` when cancelling a generator-based task (asyncio)
- Fixed ``wait_all_tasks_blocked()`` not working with generator-based tasks (asyncio)
- Fixed an unnecessary delay in ``connect_tcp()`` if an earlier attempt succeeds

  simultaneously

**1.2.1**

- Fixed cancellation errors leaking from a task group when they are contained in an exception group

- Implemented the Happy Eyeballs (:rfc:`6555`) algorithm for ``anyio.connect_tcp()``
- Fixed ``KeyError`` on asyncio and curio where entering and exiting a cancel scope happens in
  different tasks
- Fixed deprecation warnings on Python 3.8 about the ``loop`` argument of ``asyncio.Event()``
- Forced the use ``WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy`` in ``asyncio.run`` when on Windows and asyncio
  to keep network functionality working
- Worker threads are now spawned with ``daemon=True`` on all backends, not just trio
