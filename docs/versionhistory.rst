  trying to receive from the stream after a closing handshake
- Fixed ``AttributeError`` when cancelling a task group's scope inside an async test fixture on
  asyncio
- Fixed ``wait_all_tasks_blocked()`` raising ``AttributeError`` on asyncio if a native task is
  waiting on an async generator's ``asend()`` method

**2.0.0**

- General new features:

  - Added support for subprocesses
  - Added support for "blocking portals" which allow running functions in the event loop thread
    from external threads
  - Added the ``anyio.aclose_forcefully()`` function for closing asynchronous resources as quickly
    as possible

- General changes/fixes:

  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Some functions have been renamed or removed (see further below for
    socket/fileio API changes):

    - ``finalize()`` → (removed; use ``async_generator.aclosing()`` instead)
    - ``receive_signals()`` → ``open_signal_receiver()``
    - ``run_in_thread()`` → ``run_sync_in_worker_thread()``
    - ``current_default_thread_limiter()`` → ``current_default_worker_thread_limiter()``
    - ``ResourceBusyError`` → ``BusyResourceError``
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Exception classes were moved to the top level package
  - Dropped support for Python 3.5
  - Bumped minimum versions of trio and curio to v0.16 and v1.4, respectively
  - Changed the ``repr()`` of ``ExceptionGroup`` to match trio's ``MultiError``

- Backend specific changes and fixes:

  - ``asyncio``: Added support for ``ProactorEventLoop``. This allows asyncio applications to use
    AnyIO on Windows even without using AnyIO as the entry point.
  - ``asyncio``: The asyncio backend now uses ``asyncio.run()`` behind the scenes which properly
    shuts down async generators and cancels any leftover native tasks
  - ``curio``: Worked around the limitation where a task can only be cancelled twice (any
    cancellations beyond that were ignored)
  - ``asyncio`` + ``curio``: a cancellation check now calls ``sleep(0)``, allowing the scheduler to
    switch to a different task
  - ``asyncio`` + ``curio``: Host name resolution now uses `IDNA 2008`_ (with UTS 46 compatibility
    mapping, just like trio)
  - ``asyncio`` + ``curio``: Fixed a bug where a task group would abandon its subtasks if its own
    cancel scope was cancelled while it was waiting for subtasks to finish
  - ``asyncio`` + ``curio``: Fixed recursive tracebacks when a single exception from an inner task
    group is reraised in an outer task group

- Socket/stream changes:

  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** The stream class structure was completely overhauled. There are now
    separate abstract base classes for receive and send streams, byte streams and reliable and
    unreliable object streams. Stream wrappers are much better supported by this new ABC structure
    and a new "typed extra attribute" system that lets you query the wrapper chain for the
    attributes you want via ``.extra(...)``.
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Socket server functionality has been refactored into a
    network-agnostic listener system
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** TLS functionality has been split off from ``SocketStream`` and can
    now work over any bidirectional bytes-based stream – you can now establish a TLS encrypted
    communications pathway over UNIX sockets or even memory object streams. The ``TLSRequired``
    exception has also been removed as it is no longer necessary.
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Buffering functionality (``receive_until()`` and
    ``receive_exactly()``) was split off from ``SocketStream`` into a stream wrapper class
    (``anyio.streams.buffered.BufferedByteReceiveStream``)
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** IPv6 addresses are now reported as 2-tuples. If original 4-tuple
    form contains a nonzero scope ID, it is appended to the address with ``%`` as the separator.
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Byte streams (including socket streams) now raise ``EndOfStream``
    instead of returning an empty bytes object when the stream has been closed from the other end
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** The socket API has changes:

    - ``create_tcp_server()`` → ``create_tcp_listener()``
    - ``create_unix_server()`` → ``create_unix_listener()``
    - ``create_udp_socket()`` had some of its parameters changed:

      - ``interface`` → ``local_address``
      - ``port`` → ``local_port``
      - ``reuse_address`` was replaced with ``reuse_port`` (and sets ``SO_REUSEPORT`` instead of
        ``SO_REUSEADDR``)
    - ``connect_tcp()`` had some of its parameters changed:

      - ``address`` → ``remote_address``
      - ``port`` → ``remote_port``
      - ``bind_host`` → ``local_address``
      - ``bind_port`` → (removed)
      - ``autostart_tls`` → ``tls``
      - ``tls_hostname`` (new parameter, when you want to match the certificate against against
        something else than ``remote_address``)
    - ``connect_tcp()`` now returns a ``TLSStream`` if TLS was enabled
    - ``notify_socket_closing()`` was removed, as it is no longer used by AnyIO
    - ``SocketStream`` has changes to its methods and attributes:

        - ``address`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.local_address)``
        - ``alpn_protocol`` → ``.extra(TLSAttribute.alpn_protocol)``
        - ``close()`` → ``aclose()``
        - ``get_channel_binding`` → ``.extra(TLSAttribute.channel_binding_tls_unique)``
        - ``cipher`` → ``.extra(TLSAttribute.cipher)``
        - ``getpeercert`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.peer_certificate)`` or
          ``.extra(SocketAttribute.peer_certificate_binary)``
        - ``getsockopt()`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.raw_socket).getsockopt(...)``
        - ``peer_address`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.remote_address)``
        - ``receive_chunks()`` → (removed; use ``async for`` on the stream instead)
        - ``receive_delimited_chunks()`` → (removed)
        - ``receive_exactly()`` → ``BufferedReceiveStream.receive_exactly()``
        - ``receive_some()`` → ``receive()``
        - ``receive_until()`` → ``BufferedReceiveStream.receive_until()``
        - ``send_all()`` → ``send()``
        - ``setsockopt()`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.raw_socket).setsockopt(...)``
        - ``shared_ciphers`` → ``.extra(TLSAttribute.shared_ciphers)``
        - ``server_side`` → ``.extra(TLSAttribute.server_side)``
        - ``start_tls()`` → ``stream = TLSStream.wrap(...)``
        - ``tls_version`` → ``.extra(TLSAttribute.tls_version)``
    - ``UDPSocket`` has changes to its methods and attributes:

      - ``address`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.local_address)``
      - ``getsockopt()`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.raw_socket).getsockopt(...)``
      - ``port`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.local_port)``
      - ``receive()`` no longer takes a maximum bytes argument
      - ``receive_packets()`` → (removed; use ``async for`` on the UDP socket instead)
      - ``send()`` → requires a tuple for destination now (address, port), for compatibility with
        the new ``UnreliableObjectStream`` interface. The ``sendto()`` method works like the old
        ``send()`` method.
      - ``setsockopt()`` → ``.extra(SocketAttribute.raw_socket).setsockopt(...)``
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Renamed the ``max_size`` parameter to ``max_bytes`` wherever it
    occurred (this was inconsistently named ``max_bytes`` in some subclasses before)
  - Added memory object streams as a replacement for queues
  - Added stream wrappers for encoding/decoding unicode strings
  - Support for the ``SO_REUSEPORT`` option (allows binding more than one socket to the same
    address/port combination, as long as they all have this option set) has been added to TCP
    listeners and UDP sockets
  - The ``send_eof()`` method was added to all (bidirectional) streams

- File I/O changes:

  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Asynchronous file I/O functionality now uses a common code base
    (``anyio.AsyncFile``) instead of backend-native classes
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** The File I/O API has changes to its functions and methods:

    - ``aopen()`` → ``open_file()``
    - ``AsyncFileclose()`` → ``AsyncFileaclose()``

- Task synchronization changes:

  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Queues were replaced by memory object streams
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Added the ``acquire()`` and ``release()`` methods to the ``Lock``,
    ``Condition`` and ``Semaphore`` classes
  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the ``Event.clear()`` method. You must now replace the event
    object with a new one rather than clear the old one.
  - Fixed ``Condition.wait()`` not working on asyncio and curio (PR by Matt Westcott)

- Testing changes:

  - **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the ``--anyio-backends`` command line option for the pytest
    plugin. Use the ``-k`` option to do ad-hoc filtering, and the ``anyio_backend`` fixture to
    control which backends you wish to run the tests by default.
  - The pytest plugin was refactored to run the test and all its related async fixtures inside the
    same event loop, making async fixtures much more useful
  - Fixed Hypothesis support in the pytest plugin (it was not actually running the Hypothesis
    tests at all)
